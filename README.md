## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
### What I learned

Practiced positioning for the share icons, gaining a better understanding of positioning elements on a page.



### Continued development

Perfect placing for the share icons on mobile version of the page. I need to work on that area.
I had to improvise with my design to make it functional for now.
